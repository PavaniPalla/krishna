    <h1>Flower</h1><hr>
    <p>A <b>flower,</b> also known as a <b>bloom</b>or <b>blossom,</b> is the reproductive structure found in <font color="blue">flowering plants</font> (plants of the division <font color="blue">Angiospermae</font>). Flowers consist of a combination of vegetative organs – <font color="blue">sepals</font> that enclose and protect the developing flower, petals that attract pollinators, and reproductive organs that produce <font color="blue">gametophytes</font>, which in flowering plants produce<font color="blue">gametes</font>. The male gametophytes, which produce sperm, are enclosed within pollen grains produced in the <font color="blue">anthers</font>. The female gametophytes are contained within the <font color="blue">ovules</font> produced in the <font color="blue">carpels</font>.</p>
    <p>Most flowering plants depend on animals, such as<font color="blue">bees</font>,<font color="blue"> moths</font>, and <font color="blue">butterflies</font>, to transfer their pollen between different flowers, and have evolved to attract these <font color="blue">pollinators</font> by various strategies, including brightly colored, conspicuous petals, attractive scents, and the production of<font color="blue">nectar</font>, a food source for pollinators.<sup><font color="blue">[1]</font></sup> In this way, many flowering plants have <font color="blue">co-evolved</font> with pollinators to be mutually dependent on services they provide to one another—in the plant's case, a means of reproduction; in the pollinator's case, a source of food.<sup><font color="blue">[2]</font></sup></p>

    <br><p>When <font color="blue">pollen</font> from the <font color="blue">anther</font> of a flower is deposited on the <font color="blue">stigma</font>, this is called <font color="blue">pollination</font>. Some flowers may <font color="blue">self-pollinate</font>, producing seed using pollen from a different flower of the same plant, but others have mechanisms to prevent self-pollination and rely on <font color="blue">cross-pollination</font>, when pollen is transferred from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same <font color="blue">species</font>. Self-pollination happens in flowers where the <font color="blue">stamen</font> and <font color="blue">carpel</font> mature at the same time, and are positioned so that the pollen can land on the flower's stigma. This pollination does not require an investment from the plant to provide nectar and pollen as food for pollinators.<sup>[3]</sup> Some flowers produce <font color="blue">diaspores</font> without fertilization (<font color="blue">parthenocarpy</font>). After fertilization, the <font color="blue">ovary</font> of the flower develops into <font color="blue">fruit</font> containing <font color="blue">seeds</font>.</p>
    <p>Flowers have long been appreciated by humans for their beauty and pleasant scents, and also hold cultural significance as religious, ritual, or symbolic objects, or sources of <font color="blue">medicine</font> and<font color="blue">food</font>.</p>
    <h2>Etymology</h2><hr>
    <p>Flower is from the <font color="blue">Middle English</font><i>flour</i>, which referred to both the <font color="blue">ground grain</font> and the reproductive structure in plants, before splitting off in the 17th century. It comes originally from the <font color="blue">Latin</font> name of the Italian goddess of flowers, <font color="blue">Flora</font>. The early word for flower in English was blossom,<sup><font color="blue">[4]</font></sup> though it now refers to flowers only of <font color="blue">fruit trees</font>.<sup><font color="blue">[5]</font></sup></p>
    <h2>Morphology</h2><hr>
    <p><i>Main article:<font color="blue">Floral morphology</font></i></p>

    <p>The <font color="blue">morphology</font> of a flower, or its form and structure,<sup><font color="blue">[6]</font></sup>can be considered in two parts: the vegetative part, consisting of non-reproductive structures such as <font color="blue">petals</font>; and the reproductive or sexual parts. A stereotypical flower is made up of four kinds of structures attached to the tip of a short stalk or axis, called a <font color="blue">receptacle</font>. Each of these parts or floral organs is arranged in a spiral called a <font color="blue">whorl</font>.<sup><font color="blue">[7]</font></sup> The four main whorls (starting from the base of the flower or lowest node and working upwards) are the <font color="blue">calyx</font>, <font color="blue">corolla</font>, <font color="blue">androecium</font>, and <font color="blue">gynoecium</font>. Together the calyx and corolla make up the non-reproductive part of the flower called the <font color="blue">perianth</font>, and in some cases may not be differentiated. If this is the case, then they are described as <font color="blue">tepals</font>.<sup><font color="blue">[8]</font></sup></p>
    <h2><b>Perianth</b></h2>
    <p><i>Main article: <font color="blue">Perianth</font></i></p>
    <h4>Calyx</h4>
    <p>The <font color="blue">sepals</font>, collectively called the calyx, are modified<font color="blue">leaves</font>that occur on the outermost whorl of the flower. They are leaf-like, in that they have a broad base,<font color="blue">stomata</font>,<font color="blue">stipules</font>, and <font color="blue">chlorophyll.<sup>[9]</sup></p></font>Sepals are often waxy and tough, and grow quickly to protect the flower as it develops.<font color="blue"><sup>[9][10]</sup></font> They may be <font color="blue">deciduous</font>, but will more commonly grow on to assist in fruit dispersal. If the calyx is fused together it is called gamosepalous.<font color="blue"><sup>[9]</sup></font></p>
    <h4>Corolla</h4>
    <p>The <font color="blue">petals</font>, together the corolla, are almost or completely fiberless leaf-like structures that form the innermost whorl of the perianth. They are often delicate and thin, and are usually coloured, shaped, or scented to encourage pollination.<font color="blue"><sup>[11]</sup></font> Although similar to leaves in shape, they are more comparable to stamens in that they form almost simultaneously with one another, but their subsequent growth is delayed. If the corolla is fused together it is called sympetalous.<font color="blue"><sup>[12]</sup></font></p>
    <h2>Reproductive</h2>
    <p><i>Main article:<font color="blue">Plant reproductive morphology</font></i></p>
    
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Lillium_Stamens.jpg/330px-Lillium_Stamens.jpg"/>
    <br><h4>Androecium</h4>
    <p>The <font color="blue">androecium</font>, or stamens, is the whorl of pollen-producing male parts. Stamens consist typically of an anther, made up of four pollen sacs arranged in two <font color="blue">thecae</font>, connected to a filament, or stalk. The anther contains microsporocytes which become <font color="blue">pollen</font>, the male <font color="blue">gametophyte</font>, after undergoing <font color="blue">meiosis</font>. Although they exhibit the widest variation among floral organs, the androecium is usually confined just to one whorl and to two whorls only in rare cases. Stamens range in number, size, shape, orientation, and in their point of connection to the flower.<font color="blue"><sup>[11][12]</sup></font></p>

        <p>In general there is only one type of stamen, but there are plant species where the flowers have two types; a "normal" one and one with anthers that produce sterile pollen meant to attract pollinators.<font color="blue"><sup>[13]</sup></font></p>
        <h4>Gynoecium</h4>
        <p>The <font color="blue">gynoecium</font>, or the carpels, is the female part of the flower found on the innermost whorl. Each carpel consists of a <font color="blue">stigma</font>, which receives pollen, a style, which acts as a stalk, and an <font color="blue">ovary</font>, which contains the ovules. Carpels may occur in one to several whorls, and when fused together are often described as a pistil. Inside the ovary, the <font color="blue">ovules</font> are attached to the<font color="blue">placenta</font> by structures called funiculi.<font color="blue"><sup>[14][15]</sup></font></p>
        <h2>Variation</h2>
        <p>Although this arrangement is considered "typical", plant species show a wide variation in floral structure.<font color="blue"><sup>[16]</sup></font> The four main parts of a flower are generally defined by their positions on the receptacle and not by their function. Many flowers lack some parts or parts may be modified into other functions or look like what is typically another part.<font color="blue">[17]</font> In some families, such as the <font color="blue">grasses</font>, the petals are greatly reduced; in many species, the sepals are colorful and petal-like. Other flowers have modified stamens that are petal-like; the double flowers of <font color="blue">Peonies</font> and <font color="blue">Roses</font> are mostly petaloid stamens.<font color="blue"><sup>[18]</sup></font></p>
        <p>Many flowers have <font color="blue">symmetry</font>. When the <font color="blue">perianth</font> is bisected through the central axis from any point and symmetrical halves are produced, the flower is said to be <font color="blue">actinomorphic</font> or regular. This is an example of<font color="blue">radial symmetry</font>. When flowers are bisected and produce only one line that produces symmetrical halves, the flower is said to be irregular or <font color="blue">zygomorphic</font>. If, in rare cases, they have no symmetry at all they are called asymmetric.<font color="blue"><sup>[19][20]</sup></font></p>
        <p>Flowers may be directly attached to the plant at their base (<font color="blue">sessile</font>—the supporting stalk or stem is highly reduced or absent).<font color="blue"><sup>[21]</sup></font> The stem or stalk subtending a flower, or an <font color="blue">inflorescence</font> of flowers, is called a <font color="blue">peduncle</font>. If a peduncle supports more than one flower, the stems connecting each flower to the main axis are called <font color="blue">pedicels</font>.<font color="blue"><sup>[22]</sup></font> The apex of a flowering stem forms a terminal swelling which is called the torus or receptacle.<font color="blue"><sup>[20]</sup></font></p>
        <p>In the majority of species, individual flowers have both <font color="blue">pistils</font> and stamens. These flowers are described by botanists as being perfect, bisexual, or <font color="blue">hermaphrodite</font>. In some species of plants the flowers are imperfect or unisexual: having only either male (stamens) or female (pistil) parts. If unisexual male and female flowers appear on the same plant, the species is called <font color="blue">monoecious</font>.<font color="blue"><sup>[23]</sup></font> However, if an individual plant is either female or male the species is called <font color="blue">dioecious</font>. Many flowers have <font color="blue">nectaries</font>, which are glands that produce a sugary fluid used to attract pollinators. They are not considered as an organ on their own.<font color="blue"><sup>[24]</sup></font></p>
        <h4>Inflorescence</h4>
        <p><i>Main article: <font color="blue">Inflorescence</font></i></p>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/White_and_yellow_flower.JPG/330px-White_and_yellow_flower.JPG"/>
        <br><p>In those species that have more than one flower on an axis, the collective cluster of flowers is called an <font color="blue">inflorescence</font>. Some inflorescences are composed of many small flowers arranged in a formation that resembles a single flower. A common example of this is most members of the very large composite (<font color="blue">Asteraceae</font>) group. A single <font color="blue">daisy</font> or <font color="blue">sunflower</font>, for example, is not a flower but a flower <font color="blue">head</font>—an inflorescence composed of numerous flowers (or florets).<font color="blue"><sup>[26]</sup></font> An inflorescence may include specialized stems and modified leaves known as <font color="blue">bracts</font>.<font color="blue"><sup>[27]</sup></font></p>
        <h4>Floral diagrams and formulae</h4>
        <p><i>Main articles: <font color="blue">Floral formula</font> and <font color="blue">Floral diagram</font></i></p>
        <p>A <i>floral formula</i> is a way to represent the structure of a flower using specific letters, numbers, and symbols, presenting substantial information about the flower in a compact form. It can represent a <font color="blue">taxon</font>, usually giving ranges of the numbers of different organs, or particular species. Floral formulae have been developed in the early 19th century and their use has declined since. Prenner et al. (2010) devised an extension of the existing model to broaden the descriptive capability of the formula.<font color="blue"><sup>[28]</sup></font> The format of floral formulae differs in different parts of the world, yet they convey the same information.<font color="blue"><sup>[29][30][31][32]</sup></font>
        <p>The structure of a flower can also be expressed by the means of <font color="blue">floral diagrams</font>. The use of schematic diagrams can replace long descriptions or complicated drawings as a tool for understanding both floral structure and evolution. Such diagrams may show important features of flowers, including the relative positions of the various organs, including the presence of fusion and symmetry, as well as structural details.<font color="blue"><sup>[33]</sup></font></p>
        <h2>Development</h2><hr>
        <p>A flower develops on a modified shoot or axis from a determinate apical <font color="blue">meristem</font>(determinate meaning the axis grows to a set size). It has compressed internodes, bearing structures that in classical plant morphology are interpreted as highly modified<font color="blue">leaves</font>.<font color="blue"><sup>[34]</sup></font>Detailed developmental studies, however, have shown that stamens are often initiated more or less like <font color="blue">modified stems</font> (caulomes) that in some cases may even resemble<font color="blue">branchlets</font>.<font color="blue"><sup>[35][16]</sup></font> Taking into account the whole diversity in the development of the androecium of flowering plants, we find a continuum between modified leaves (phyllomes), modified stems (caulomes), and modified branchlets (shoots).<font color="blue"><sup>[36][37]</sup></font></p>
        <h4>Transition</h4>
        <p>The transition to flowering is one of the major phase changes that a plant makes during its life cycle. The transition must take place at a time that is favorable for <font color="blue">fertilization</font> and the formation of <font color="blue">seeds</font>, hence ensuring maximal <font color="blue">reproductive</font> success. To meet these needs a plant is able to interpret important endogenous and environmental cues such as changes in levels of <font color="blue">plant hormones</font> and seasonable <font color="blue">temperature</font> and <font color="blue">photoperiod</font> changes.<font color="blue"><sup>[38]</sup></font> Many <font color="blue">perennial</font> and most <font color="blue">biennial</font> plants require <font color="blue">vernalization</font> to flower. The molecular interpretation of these signals is through the transmission of a complex signal known as <font color="blue">florigen</font>, which involves a variety of <font color="blue">genes</font>, including Constans, Flowering Locus C, and Flowering Locus T. Florigen is produced in the leaves in reproductively favorable conditions and acts in <font color="blue">buds</font> and growing tips to induce a number of different physiological and morphological changes.<font color="blue"><sup>[39]</sup></font></p>
        <p>The first step of the transition is the transformation of the vegetative stem primordia into floral primordia. This occurs as biochemical changes take place to change cellular differentiation of leaf, bud and stem tissues into tissue that will grow into the reproductive organs. Growth of the central part of the stem tip stops or flattens out and the sides develop protuberances in a whorled or spiral fashion around the outside of the stem end. These protuberances develop into the sepals, petals, stamens, and<font color="blue">carpels</font>. Once this process begins, in most plants, it cannot be reversed and the stems develop flowers, even if the initial start of the flower formation event was dependent of some environmental cue.<font color="blue"><sup>[40]</sup></font></p>
        <h4>Organ development</h4>
        <p><i>Main article: <font color="blue">ABC model of flower development</font></i></p>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/ABC_flower_development.svg/255px-ABC_flower_development.svg.png"/>
        
        <p>The ABC model is a simple model that describes the <font color="blue">genes</font> responsible for the development of flowers. Three gene activities interact in a combinatorial manner to determine the developmental identities of the <font color="blue">primordia</font> organ within the  floral <font color="blue">apical meristem</font>. These gene functions are called A, B, and C. A genes are expressed in only outer and lower most section of the apical meristem, which becomes a whorl of sepals. In the second whorl both A and B genes are expressed, leading to the formation of petals. In the third whorl, B and C genes interact to form stamens and in the center of the flower C genes alone give rise to carpels. The model is based upon studies of aberrant flowers and mutations in <font color="blue"><i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i></font> and the snapdragon, <font color="blue"><i>Antirrhinum majus</i></font>. For example, when there is a loss of B gene function, mutant flowers are produced with sepals in the first whorl as usual, but also in the second whorl instead of the normal petal formation. In the third whorl the lack of B function but presence of C function mimics the fourth whorl, leading to the formation of carpels also in the third whorl.<font color="blue"><sup>[41]</sup></font></p>

        <h2>Function</h2><hr>
        <p><i>See also: <font color="blue">Plant reproductive morphology</font></i></p>
        <p>The principal purpose of a flower is the reproduction<font color="blue"><sup>[42]</sup></font> of the individual and the species. All flowering plants are <font color="blue"><i>heterosporous</i></font>, that is, every individual plant produces two types of <font color="blue">spores</font>. Microspores are produced by <font color="blue">meiosis</font> inside anthers and megaspores are produced inside ovules that are within an ovary. Anthers typically consist of four microsporangia and an ovule is an integumented megasporangium. Both types of spores develop into <font color="blue">gametophytes</font> inside sporangia. As with all heterosporous plants, the gametophytes also develop inside the spores, i. e., they are endosporic.</p>
        <h2>Pollination</h2><hr>
        <p><i>Main article: <font color="blue">Pollination</font></i></p>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Bees_Collecting_Pollen_cropped.jpg/300px-Bees_Collecting_Pollen_cropped.jpg"/>
        <p>Since the flowers are the reproductive organs of the plant, they mediate the joining of the sperm, contained within pollen, to the ovules — contained in the ovary.<font color="blue"><sup>[10]</sup></font> Pollination is the movement of pollen from the anthers to the stigma.<font color="blue"><sup>[43]</sup></font> Normally pollen is moved from one plant to another, known as <font color="blue">cross-pollination</font>, but many plants are able to self-pollinate. Cross-pollination is preferred because it allows for <font color="blue">genetic variation</font>, which contributes to the survival of the species.<font color="blue"><sup>[44]</sup></font> Many flowers depend on external factors for pollination, such as: the wind, water, animals, and especially <font color="blue">insects</font>. Larger animals such as birds, bats, and even some <font color="blue">pygmy possums</font>,<font color="blue"><sup>[45]</sup></font> however, can also be employed.<font color="blue"><sup>[46][47]</sup></font> To accomplish this, flowers have specific designs which encourage the transfer of pollen from one plant to another of the same species. The period of time during which this process can take place (when the flower is fully expanded and functional) is called <font color="blue"><i>anthesis</i></font>,<font color="blue"><sup>[48]</sup></font> hence the study of pollination biology is called <font color="blue"><i>anthecology</i></font>.<font color="blue"><sup>[49]</sup></font></p>
        <p>Flowering plants usually face <font color="blue">evolutionary pressure</font> to optimize the transfer of their <font color="blue">pollen</font>, and this is typically reflected in the morphology of the flowers and the behavior of the plants.<font color="blue"><sup>[50]</sup></font> Pollen may be transferred between plants via a number of 'vectors,' or methods. Around 80% of flowering plants make use of biotic, or living vectors. Others use abiotic, or non-living, vectors and some plants make use of multiple vectors, but most are highly specialised.<font color="blue"><sup>[51]</sup></font></p> 
        <p>Though some fit between or outside of these groups,<font color="blue"><sup>[52]</sup></font> most flowers can be divided between the following two broad groups of pollination methods:</p>
        <h3>Biotic pollination</h3>
        <p>Flowers that use biotic vectors attract and use<font color="blue">insects</font>, <font color="blue">bats</font>, <font color="blue">birds</font>, or other animals to transfer pollen from one flower to the next. Often they are <font color="blue">specialized</font> in shape and have an arrangement of the stamens that ensures that pollen grains are transferred to the bodies of the pollinator when it lands in search of its attractant (such as nectar, pollen, or a mate).<font color="blue"><sup>[53]</sup></font> In pursuing this attractant from many flowers of the same species, the pollinator transfers pollen to the stigmas—arranged with equally pointed precision—of all of the flowers it visits.<font color="blue"><sup>[54]</sup></font> Many flowers rely on simple proximity between flower parts to ensure pollination, while others have elaborate designs to ensure pollination and prevent<font color="blue"> self-pollination</font>.<font color="blue"><sup>[44]</sup></font> Flowers use animals including: insects (<font color="blue"><i>entomophily</i></font>), birds (<font color="blue"><i>ornithophily</i></font>), bats (<font color="blue"><i>chiropterophily</i></font>), lizards,<font color="blue"><sup>[47]</sup></font> and even snails and slugs (malacophilae).<font color="blue"><sup>[55]</sup></font></p>
        <h4>Attraction methods</h4>
        <p>Plants cannot move from one location to another, thus many flowers have evolved to attract animals to transfer pollen between individuals in dispersed populations. Most commonly, flowers are insect-pollinated, known as <font color="blue"><i>entomophilous</i></font>; literally "insect-loving" in Greek.<font color="blue"><sup>[57]</sup></font> To attract these insects flowers commonly have glands called nectaries on various parts that attract animals looking for nutritious <font color="blue">nectar</font>.<font color="blue"><sup>[58]</sup></font> Some flowers have glands called <font color="blue">elaiophores</font>, which produce oils rather than nectar.<font color="blue"><sup>[59]</sup></font> Birds and bees have <font color="blue">color vision</font>, enabling them to seek out colorful flowers.<font color="blue"><sup>[60]</sup></font> Some flowers have patterns, called <font color="blue">nectar guides</font>, that show pollinators where to look for nectar; they may be visible only under<font color="blue"> ultraviolet</font> light, which is visible to bees and some other insects.<font color="blue"><sup>[61]</sup></font></p>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Ophrys_apifera_flower1.jpg/327px-Ophrys_apifera_flower1.jpg"/>
        <p>Flowers also attract pollinators by <font color="blue">scent</font>, though not all flower scents are appealing to humans; a number of flowers are pollinated by insects that are attracted to rotten flesh and have flowers that smell like dead animals. These are often called <font color="blue">Carrion flowers</font>, including plants in the genus <font color="blue"><i>Rafflesia</i>   </font>, and the <font color="blue">titan arum</font>.<font color="blue"><sup>[60]</sup></font> Flowers pollinated by night visitors, including bats and moths, are likely to concentrate on scent to attract pollinators and so most such flowers are white.<font color="blue"><sup>[62]</sup></font> Some plants pollinated by bats have a sonar-reflecting petal above its flowers, which helps the bat find them,<font color="blue"><sup>[63]</sup></font> and one species, the cactus <i><b>Espostoa frutescens</b></i>, has flowers that are surrounded by an area of sound-absorbent and wooly hairs called the cephalium, which absorbs the bat's ultrasound instead.<font color="blue"><sup>[64]</sup></font></p>
        <p>Flowers are also specialized in shape and have an arrangement of the <font color="blue">stamens</font> that ensures that pollen grains are transferred to the bodies of the pollinator when it lands in search of its attractant. Other flowers use mimicry or <font color="blue">pseudocopulation</font> to attract pollinators. Many orchids for example, produce flowers resembling female bees or wasps in colour, shape, and scent. Males move from one flower to the next in search of a mate, pollinating the flowers.<font color="blue"><sup>[65][66]</sup></font></p>
        <h4>Pollinator relationships</h4>
        <p><i>Further information:<font color="blue">Pollination syndrome</font></i></p>
        <p>Many flowers have close relationships with one or a few specific pollinating organisms. Many flowers, for example, attract only one specific species of insect, and therefore rely on that insect for successful reproduction. This close relationship an example of <font color="blue">coevolution</font>, as the flower and pollinator have developed together over a long period of time to match each other's needs.<font color="blue"><sup>[67]</sup></font> This close relationship compounds the negative effects of <font color="blue">extinction</font>, however, since the extinction of either member in such a relationship would almost certainly mean the extinction of the other member as well.<font color="blue"><sup>[68]</sup></font></p>
        <h2>Abiotic pollination</h2>
        <p><i>Main articles: <font color="blue">Anemophily</font> and <font color="blue">Hydrophily</font></i></p>
        <p>Flowers that use abiotic, or non-living, vectors use the <font color="blue">wind</font> or, much less commonly, <font color="blue">water</font>, to move pollen from one flower to the next.<font color="blue"><sup>[51]</sup></font> In wind-dispersed (<font color="blue">anemophilous</font>) species, the tiny pollen grains are carried, sometimes many thousands of kilometres,<font color="blue"><sup>[69]</sup></font> by the wind to other flowers. Common examples include the <font color="blue">grasses</font>,<font color="blue"> birch trees</font>, along with many other species in the order <font color="blue"><i>Fagales</i></font>,<font color="blue"><sup>[70]</sup> ragweeds</font>, and many  <font color="blue">sedges</font>. They have no need to attract pollinators and therefore tend not to grow large, showy, or colorful flowers, and do not have nectaries, nor a noticeable scent. Because of this, plants typically have many thousands of tiny flowers which have comparatively large, feathery stigmas; to increase the chance of pollen being received.<font color="blue"><sup>[65]</sup></font> Whereas the pollen of entomophilous flowers is usually large, sticky, and rich in <font color="blue">protein</font> (to act as a "reward" for pollinators), anemophilous flower pollen is typically small-grained, very light, smooth, and of little nutritional value to<font color="blue"> insects</font>.<font color="blue"><sup>[71][72]</sup></font> In order for the wind to effectively pick up and transport the pollen, the flowers typically have anthers loosely attached to the end of long thin filaments, or pollen forms around a <font color="blue">catkin</font> which moves in the wind. Rarer forms of this involve individual flowers being moveable by the wind (<font color="blue">Pendulous</font>), or even less commonly; the anthers exploding to release the pollen into the wind.<font color="blue"><sup>[71]</sup></font></p>

        <p>Pollination through water (<font color="blue">hydrophily</font>) is a much rarer method, occurring in only around 2% of abiotically pollinated flowers.<font color="blue"><sup>[51]</sup></font> Common examples of this include <i>Calitriche autumnalis, <font color="blue">Vallisneria spiralis</font></i> and some <font color="blue">sea-grasses</font>. One characteristic which most species in this group share is a lack of an <font color="blue">exine</font>, or protective layer, around the pollen grain.<font color="blue"><sup>[73]</sup></font> Paul Knuth identified two types of hydrophilous pollination in 1906 and Ernst Schwarzenbach added a third in 1944. Knuth named his two groups 'Hyphydrogamy' and the more common 'Ephydrogamy.'<font color="blue"><sup>[74]</sup></font> In hyphydrogamy pollination occurs below the surface of the water and so the pollen grains are typically negatively<font color="blue"> buoyant</font>. For marine plants that exhibit this method the stigmas are usually stiff, while freshwater species have small and feathery stigmas.<font color="blue"><sup>[75]</sup></font> In ephydrogamy pollination occurs on the surface of the water and so the pollen has a low density to enable floating, though many also use rafts, and are <font color="blue">hydrophobic</font>. Marine flowers have floating thread-like stigmas and may have adaptations for the tide, while freshwater species create indentations in the water.<font color="blue"><sup>[75]</sup></font> The third category, set out by Schwarzenbach, is those flowers which transport pollen above the water through conveyance. This ranges from floating plants, (<font color="blue">Lemnoideae</font>), to <font color="blue">staminate</font> flowers (<font color="blue"><i>Vallisneria</i></font>). Most species in this group have dry, spherical pollen which sometimes forms into larger masses, and female flowers which form depressions in the water; the method of transport varies.<font color="blue"><sup>[75]</sup></font></p>
        <h2>Mechanisms</h2>
        <p>Flowers can be pollinated by two mechanisms; cross-pollination and self-pollination. No mechanism is indisputably better than the other as they each have their advantages and disadvantages. Plants use one or both of these mechanisms depending on their <font color="blue">habitat</font> and <font color="blue">ecological</font> <font color="blue">niche</font>.<font color="blue"><sup>[76]</sup></font></p>
        <h4>Cross-pollination</h4>
        <p>Cross-pollination is the pollination of the carpel by pollen from a different plant of the same species. Because the genetic make-up of the sperm contained within the pollen from the other plant is different, their combination will result in a new, genetically distinct, plant, through the process of <font color="blue">sexual reproduction</font>. Since each new plant is genetically distinct, the different plants show <font color="blue">variation</font> in their physiological and structural adaptations and so the <font color="blue">population</font> as a whole is better prepared for an adverse occurrence in the environment. Cross-pollination, therefore, increases the survival of the species and is usually preferred by flowers for this reason.<font color="blue"><sup>[44][77]</sup></font></p>
        <h4>Self-pollination</h4>
        <p>Self-pollination is the pollination of the carpel of a flower by pollen from either the same flower or another flower on the same plant,<font color="blue"><sup>[44]</sup></font> leading to the creation of a genetic clone through <font color="blue">asexual reproduction</font>. This increases the reliability of producing seeds, the rate at which they can be produced, and lowers the amount energy needed.<font color="blue"><sup>[78]</sup></font> But, most importantly, it limits <font color="blue">genetic variation</font>. In addition, self-pollination causes <font color="blue">inbreeding depression</font>, due largely to the expression of recessive deleterious <font color="blue">mutations</font>.<font color="blue"><sup>[79][80]</sup></font></p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Clianthus_puniceus_%28Kaka_Beak%29_flowers.jpg/330px-Clianthus_puniceus_%28Kaka_Beak%29_flowers.jpg" align="left"/>
        <p>The extreme case of self-fertilization, when the ovule is fertilized by pollen from the same flower or plant, occurs in flowers that always self-fertilize, such as many <font color="blue">dandelions</font>.<font color="blue"><sup>[81]</sup></font> Some flowers are self-pollinated and have flowers that never open or are self-pollinated before the flowers open; these flowers are called <font color="blue">cleistogamous</font>; many species in the genus <font color="blue"><i>Viola</i></font> exhibit this, for example.<font color="blue"><sup>[82]</sup></font></p>
        <p>Conversely, many species of plants have ways of preventing self-pollination and hence, self-fertilization. Unisexual male and female flowers on the same plant may not appear or mature at the same time, or pollen from the same plant may be incapable of fertilizing its ovules. The latter flower types, which have chemical barriers to their own pollen, are referred to as self-incompatible.<font color="blue"><sup>[23][83]</sup></font> In <font color="blue"><i>Clianthus puniceus</i></font>, (pictured), self-pollination is used strategically as an "insurance policy." When a pollinator, in this case a bird, visits C. puniceus it rubs off the stigmatic covering and allows for pollen from the bird to enter the stigma. If no pollinators visit, however, then the stigmatic covering falls off naturally to allow for the flower's own anthers to pollinate the flower through self-pollination.<font color="blue"><sup>[78]</sup></font></p>
        <br><h2>Allergies</h2>
        <p><i>Main article: <font color="blue">Pollen allergy</font></i></p>
        <p>Pollen is a large contributor to <font color="blue">asthma</font> and other <font color="blue">respiratory allergies</font> which combined affect between 10 and 50% of people worldwide. This number appears to be growing, as the temperature increases due to <font color="blue">climate change</font> mean that plants are producing more pollen<sup>[<font color="blue">citation needed</font>]</sup>, which is also more allergenic. Pollen is difficult to avoid, however, because of its small size and prevalence in the natural environment. Most of the pollen which causes allergies is that produced by wind-dispersed pollinators such as the <font color="blue">grasses</font>,<font color="blue"> birch trees</font>, <font color="blue">oak trees</font>, and <font color="blue">ragweeds</font>; the allergens in pollen are proteins which are thought to be necessary in the process of pollination.<font color="blue"><sup>[84][85]</sup></font></p>
        <h2>Fertilization</h2><hr>
        <p><i>Main articles: <font color="blue">Fertilization</font> and <font color="blue">Double fertilization</font></i></p>
        <p><font color="blue">Fertilization</font>, also called Synagmy, occurs following pollination, which is the movement of pollen from the stamen to the carpel. It encompasses both<font color="blue"> plasmogamy</font>, the fusion of the <font color="blue">protoplasts</font>, and <font color="blue">karyogamy</font>, the fusion of the <font color="blue">nuclei</font>. When pollen lands on the stigma of the flower it begins creating a <font color="blue">pollen tube</font> which runs down through the style and into the ovary. After penetrating the centre-most part of the ovary it enters the egg apparatus and into <font color="blue">one synergid</font>. At this point the end of the pollen tube bursts and releases the two sperm cells, one of which makes its way to an egg, while also losing its <font color="blue">cell membrane</font> and much of its<font color="blue"> protoplasm</font>. The sperm's nucleus then fuses with the egg's nucleus, resulting in the formation of a <font color="blue">zygote</font>, a <font color="blue">diploid</font> (two copies of each <font color="blue">chromosome</font>) cell.<font color="blue"><sup>[86]</sup></font></p>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Sex_%28electronic_resource%29_%281914%29_%2814590686978%29.jpg/300px-Sex_%28electronic_resource%29_%281914%29_%2814590686978%29.jpg"/>
        <p>Whereas in fertilization only plasmogamy, or the fusion of the whole sex cells, results, in Angiosperms (flowering plants) a process known as double fertilization, which involves both karyogamy and plasmogamy, occurs. In double fertilization the second sperm cell subsequently also enters the synergid and fuses with the two polar nuclei of the central cell. Since all three nuclei are <font color="blue">haploid</font>, they result in a large <font color="blue">endosperm</font> nucleus which is <font color="blue">triploid</font>.<font color="blue"><sup>[86]</sup></font></p>

        <p>Following the formation of zygote it begins to grow through nuclear and cellular divisions, called <font color="blue">mitosis</font>, eventually becoming a small group of cells. One section of it becomes the <font color="blue">embryo</font>, while the other becomes the suspensor; a structure which forces the embryo into the <font color="blue">endosperm</font> and is later undetectable. Two small <font color="blue">primordia</font> also form at this time, that later become the <font color="blue">cotyledon</font>, which is used as an energy store. Plants which grow out one of these primordia are called The ovary, inside which the seed is forming from the ovule, grows into a fruit. All the other main floral parts die during this development, including: the style, stigma, sepals, stamens, and petals. The fruit contains three structures: the exocarp, or outer layer, the mesocarp, or the fleshy part, and the endocarp, or innermost layer, while the fruit wall is called the pericarp. The size, shape, toughness, and thickness varies among different fruit.

        <p>Following the pollination of a flower, fertilization, and finally the development of a seed and fruit, a mechanism is typically used to disperse the fruit away from the plant.[91] </p>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Kereru_%28New_Zealand_Wood_Pigeon%29.jpg/300px-Kereru_%28New_Zealand_Wood_Pigeon%29.jpg"/><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/This_seed_of_a_maple_seed_runs_as_a_helicopter.jpg/300px-This_seed_of_a_maple_seed_runs_as_a_helicopter.jpg"/><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/Acaena_novae-zelandiae1.jpg/300px-Acaena_novae-zelandiae1.jpg"/>
        <p>In Angiosperms (flowering plants) seeds are dispersed away from the plant so as to not force competition between the mother and the daughter plants,[92] as well as to enable the colonisation of new areas. They are often divided into two categories, though many plants fall in between or in one or more of these:[93]</p>
        <h3>Allochory</h3>
        <p>In allochory, plants use an external <font color="blue">vector</font>, or carrier, to transport their seeds away from them. These can be either <font color="blue">biotic</font> (living), such as by birds and ants, or <font color="blue">abiotic</font> (non-living), such as by the wind or water.<font color="blue"><sup>[93][94][95]</sup></font></p>
        <h4>Biotic vectors</h4>
        <p><i>Main article: <font color="blue">Seed dispersal & Animals:</font> <font color="blue">epi- and endozoochory</font></i></p>
        <p>Many plants use biotic vectors to disperse their seeds away from them. This method falls under the umbrella term <i>Zoochory</i>, while <font color="blue"><i>Endozoochory</i></font>, also known as <i>fruigivory</i>, refers specifically to plants adapted to grow fruit in order to attract animals to eat them. Once eaten they go through typically go through animal's digestive system and are dispersed away from the plant.<font color="blue"><sup>[95]</sup></font> Some seeds are specially adapted either to last in the <font color="blue">gizzard</font> of animals or even to germinate better after passing through them.<font color="blue"><sup>[96][97]</sup></font> They can be eaten by birds (<i>ornithochory</i>), bats (<i>chiropterochory</i>), <font color="blue">rodents</font>, primates, ants (<font color="blue"><i>myrmecochory</i></font>),<font color="blue"><sup>[98]</sup></font> non-bird sauropsids (<i>saurochory</i>), mammals in general (<i>mammaliochory</i>),<font color="blue"><sup>[96]</sup></font> and even <font color="blue">fish</font>.<font color="blue"><sup>[99]</sup></font> Typically their fruit are fleshy, have a high nutritional value, and may have chemical attractants as an additional "reward" for dispersers. This is reflected <font color="blue">morphologically</font> in the presence of more <font color="blue">pulp</font>, an <font color="blue">aril</font>, and sometimes an <font color="blue">elaiosome</font> (primarily for ants), which are other fleshy structures.<font color="blue"><sup>[100]</sup></font></p>

        <p><font color="blue"><i>Epizoochory</i></font> occurs in plants whose seeds are adapted to cling on to animals and be dispersed that way, such as many species in the genus <font color="blue"><i>Acaena</i></font>.<font color="blue"><sup>[101]</sup></font> Typically these plants seed's have hooks or a <font color="blue">viscous</font> surface to easier grip to animals, which include birds and animals with <font color="blue">fur</font>. Some plants use <font color="blue">mimesis</font>, or imitation, to trick animals into dispersing the seeds and these often have specially adapted colors.<font color="blue"><sup>[100][102]</sup></font></p>
        <p>The final type of <i>Zoochory</i> is called <font color="red"><i>Synzoochory</i></font>, which involves neither the digestion of the seeds, nor the unintentional carrying of the seed on the body, but the deliberate carrying of the seeds by the animals. This is usually in the mouth or <font color="blue">beak</font> of the animal (called <i>Stomatochory</i>), which is what is used for many birds and all ants.<font color="blue"><sup>[103]</sup></font></p>
        <h4>Abiotic vectors</h4>

        <p>In <font color="blue"><i>Hydrochory</i></font> plants are adapted to disperse their seeds through bodies of water and so typically are buoyant and have a low <font color="blue">relative density</font> with regards to the water. Commonly seeds are adapted morphologically with hydrophobic surfaces, small size, hairs, slime, <font color="blue">oil</font>, and sometimes air spaces within the seeds.<font color="blue"><sup>[100]</sup></font> These plants fall into three categories: ones where seeds are dispersed on the surface of water currents, under the surface of water currents, and by rain landing on a plant.<font color="blue"><sup>[104]</sup></font></p>
