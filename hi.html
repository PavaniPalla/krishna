    <h1>Flower</h1><hr>
    <p>A <b>flower,</b> also known as a <b>bloom</b>or <b>blossom,</b> is the reproductive structure found in <font color="blue">flowering plants</font> (plants of the division <font color="blue">Angiospermae</font>). Flowers consist of a combination of vegetative organs – <font color="blue">sepals</font> that enclose and protect the developing flower, petals that attract pollinators, and reproductive organs that produce <font color="blue">gametophytes</font>, which in flowering plants produce<font color="blue">gametes</font>. The male gametophytes, which produce sperm, are enclosed within pollen grains produced in the <font color="blue">anthers</font>. The female gametophytes are contained within the <font color="blue">ovules</font> produced in the <font color="blue">carpels</font>.</p>
    <p>Most flowering plants depend on animals, such as<font color="blue">bees</font>,<font color="blue"> moths</font>, and <font color="blue">butterflies</font>, to transfer their pollen between different flowers, and have evolved to attract these <font color="blue">pollinators</font> by various strategies, including brightly colored, conspicuous petals, attractive scents, and the production of<font color="blue">nectar</font>, a food source for pollinators.<sup><font color="blue">[1]</font></sup> In this way, many flowering plants have <font color="blue">co-evolved</font> with pollinators to be mutually dependent on services they provide to one another—in the plant's case, a means of reproduction; in the pollinator's case, a source of food.<sup><font color="blue">[2]</font></sup></p>

    <br><p>When <font color="blue">pollen</font> from the <font color="blue">anther</font> of a flower is deposited on the <font color="blue">stigma</font>, this is called <font color="blue">pollination</font>. Some flowers may <font color="blue">self-pollinate</font>, producing seed using pollen from a different flower of the same plant, but others have mechanisms to prevent self-pollination and rely on <font color="blue">cross-pollination</font>, when pollen is transferred from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same <font color="blue">species</font>. Self-pollination happens in flowers where the <font color="blue">stamen</font> and <font color="blue">carpel</font> mature at the same time, and are positioned so that the pollen can land on the flower's stigma. This pollination does not require an investment from the plant to provide nectar and pollen as food for pollinators.<sup>[3]</sup> Some flowers produce <font color="blue">diaspores</font> without fertilization (<font color="blue">parthenocarpy</font>). After fertilization, the <font color="blue">ovary</font> of the flower develops into <font color="blue">fruit</font> containing <font color="blue">seeds</font>.</p>
    <p>Flowers have long been appreciated by humans for their beauty and pleasant scents, and also hold cultural significance as religious, ritual, or symbolic objects, or sources of <font color="blue">medicine</font> and<font color="blue">food</font>.</p>
    <h2>Etymology:</h2><hr>
    <p>Flower is from the <font color="blue">Middle English</font><i>flour</i>, which referred to both the <font color="blue">ground grain</font> and the reproductive structure in plants, before splitting off in the 17th century. It comes originally from the <font color="blue">Latin</font> name of the Italian goddess of flowers, <font color="blue">Flora</font>. The early word for flower in English was blossom,<sup><font color="blue">[4]</font></sup> though it now refers to flowers only of <font color="blue">fruit trees</font>.<sup><font color="blue">[5]</font></sup></p>

    <p>The <font color="blue">morphology</font> of a flower, or its form and structure,<sup><font color="blue">[6]</font></sup>can be considered in two parts: the vegetative part, consisting of non-reproductive structures such as <font color="blue">petals</font>; and the reproductive or sexual parts. A stereotypical flower is made up of four kinds of structures attached to the tip of a short stalk or axis, called a <font color="blue">receptacle</font>. Each of these parts or floral organs is arranged in a spiral called a <font color="blue">whorl</font>.<sup><font color="blue">[7]</font></sup> The four main whorls (starting from the base of the flower or lowest node and working upwards) are the <font color="blue">calyx</font>, <font color="blue">corolla</font>, <font color="blue">androecium</font>, and <font color="blue">gynoecium</font>. Together the calyx and corolla make up the non-reproductive part of the flower called the <font color="blue">perianth</font>, and in some cases may not be differentiated. If this is the case, then they are described as <font color="blue">tepals</font>.<sup><font color="blue">[8]</font></sup></p>
